# Third-party notices

GCSF is under the MIT licence (`LICENSE`). Its dependencies have the following licences.

| Component | Licence | Use in GCSF |
|---|---|---|
| xsflib, Copyright (c) 2026 the xsflib authors | MIT | A library for players and rippers of PSF-family formats. GCSF takes from it the PSF container and the descriptors' checks, the player framework, and the frames of the ripper and the player tool. A Git submodule in `externals/xsflib`, built into GCSF's programs. It finds or downloads the libraries below. |
| ntdlib, Copyright (c) 2026 the ntdlib authors | MIT | A library for the hardware and formats of Nintendo's consoles. GCSF takes from it the PowerPC interpreter, the DSP and its coefficient ROM, the GameCube's devices and the base of its machine, the readers of disc images, the readers of JAudio's sound files, and the length analysis of JAudio's sounds. Twilight Princess's driver includes ntdlib's start-up of the game's sound layer. A Git submodule in `externals/ntdlib`, built into GCSF's programs. |
| Data from [Unicode](https://www.unicode.org), Copyright © 1991-2026 Unicode, Inc. | Unicode-3.0 | ntdlib's `src/disc/jis0208.h`, a mapping of JIS X 0208 to Unicode derived from Unicode's JIS0208.TXT. ntdlib's disc readers decode the Shift-JIS text of GameCube discs with it: the titles of Japanese discs and the names in a disc's file system. Built into `gcsfrip`. |
| seqlib, Copyright (c) 2026 the seqlib authors | MIT (`externals/xsflib/externals/seqlib/LICENSE`) | In `externals/xsflib/externals/seqlib`, a submodule of xsflib. Only the tests use it: their checks come from it, through `xsflib::testing`. |
| [zlib](https://zlib.net), Copyright (C) 1995-2024 Jean-loup Gailly and Mark Adler | zlib | The PSF container, and GCZ disc images. The installed copy is used if there is one. Otherwise v1.3.1 is downloaded when configuring. |
| [Zstandard](https://github.com/facebook/zstd), Copyright (c) Meta Platforms, Inc. and affiliates | BSD-3-Clause | RVZ disc images. The installed copy is used if there is one. Otherwise v1.5.7 is downloaded when configuring. |
| [liblzma](https://tukaani.org/xz/) from XZ Utils | 0BSD | LZMA and LZMA2 in WIA and RVZ disc images. The installed copy is used if there is one. Otherwise v5.8.1 is downloaded when configuring. |
| [bzip2](https://sourceware.org/bzip2/), Copyright (C) 1996-2019 Julian R Seward | bzip2 (BSD-style) | bzip2 in WIA and RVZ disc images. The installed copy is used if there is one. Otherwise 1.0.8 is downloaded when configuring. |
| [libFLAC](https://xiph.org/flac/), Copyright the Xiph.Org Foundation | BSD-3-Clause | FLAC output in `gcsfplay`. The installed copy is used if there is one. Otherwise 1.5.0 is downloaded when configuring. |
| [foobar2000 SDK](https://www.foobar2000.org/SDK), Copyright Peter Pawlowski | BSD-style (the SDK's `sdk-license.txt`, and `pfc-license.txt` for its pfc library) | Only for `plugins/foobar2000`. Not included here. The SDK is supplied when building the component. |
| [XMPlay plugin SDK](https://www.un4seen.com/xmplay.html), from Un4seen Developments | None stated | Only for `plugins/xmplay`. Not included here. The SDK is supplied when building the plugin. CI downloads it from un4seen.com. The plugin uses only the SDK's declarations of XMPlay's interface. |

Binary distributions must include the MIT notices of GCSF, xsflib and ntdlib. Every program contains xsflib and
ntdlib. The Zstandard notice is required when Zstandard is linked in: `gcsfrip` links it, and `gcsfplay` and the
foobar2000 component don't. The libFLAC notice is required when libFLAC is linked in: `gcsfplay` links it, and
`gcsfrip` and the foobar2000 component don't. The Unicode License v3's notice is required where Unicode's data is linked
in: `gcsfrip` contains it, and `gcsfplay` and the foobar2000 component don't. Shipping `LICENSE` and this file meets all
six requirements. The licence texts are at the end of this file. The licences of zlib, liblzma and bzip2, and those of
the foobar2000 SDK and its pfc library, require no notice in binaries. seqlib's checks go only into tests.
No code from the XMPlay plugin SDK goes into the XMPlay plugin.

## Reference material (no code taken)

- [Dolphin](https://github.com/dolphin-emu/dolphin) (GPL-2.0-or-later) is the reference for how the DSP in ntdlib
  behaves. No code is taken from it. Where GCSF follows Dolphin's behaviour, the code was written from a description of
  that behaviour. The writer hadn't read Dolphin's source for that part. Dolphin's documentation of the WIA and RVZ
  formats (`docs/WiaAndRvz.md`) describes those formats and the generator of the padding data on GameCube and Wii discs.
- [Wiimm's ISO Tools](https://wit.wiimm.de) document the WDF and CISO formats.
- YAGCD (Yet Another GameCube Documentation) documents the GameCube's hardware and disc format.

## Game data

Nothing in this repository licenses game data. Rips (`.gcsflib`) contain a game's code and sound files. These belong to
their copyright holders.

ntdlib's `include/ntdlib/dsp/coef_rom.h` holds the DSP's coefficient ROM. Every GameCube and Wii has the same ROM. It
holds 4-tap filters: 128 phases for each of three cutoffs. The player uses the exact values to reproduce the console's
output.
